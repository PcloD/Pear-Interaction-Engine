# Pear Interaction Engine (PIE)

## About PIE
PIE is a set of cross-platform Unity components that make interacting with objects easy, reguardless of the target platform. PIE currently supports Leap Motion, Oculus Touch, and mixed reality gestures (e.g. HoloLens gestures). We plan to support more forms of input soon. Use PIE if you want an easy way to interact with objects that has growing support for new forms of input. We hope you find this useful!

## Why PIE?
Interactions are a core component of every software application, yet there are very few commonly used methods for interacting in VR and AR. Over the last year we've explored interactions using cheap headsets, expensive headsets, controllers, full body motion capture suits, and just about everything in between. In the process, we created PIE, a set of tools we've used for both rapid prototyping and production quality products. We're happy to share these tools and welcome all contributions as we look forward to the next generation of human computer interactions.
